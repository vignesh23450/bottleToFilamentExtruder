# Bottle to Filament Extruder

This project aims to create a filament extruder from recycled plastic bottles. It utilizes a 1209 temperature controller for the hotend and a gear motor with a motor driver for extrusion.

## Components Used:
- 1209 Temperature Controller
- Hotend
- Gear Motor
- Motor Driver
- Recycled Plastic Bottles (as raw material)

## Functionality:
- The 1209 temperature controller is used to regulate the temperature of the hotend to melt the plastic bottles.
- The gear motor, controlled by a motor driver, is used for extruding the melted plastic to form filament.
- The extruded filament can be used for 3D printing, thus contributing to sustainable recycling efforts.

## Assembly:
1. Mount the hotend securely in the extruder assembly.
2. Connect the 1209 temperature controller to the hotend and power source.
3. Attach the gear motor to the extruder assembly.
4. Connect the gear motor to the motor driver and power source.
5. Ensure all connections are secure and properly insulated.

## Usage:
1. Prepare plastic bottles by cleaning and shredding them into small pieces.
2. Load the shredded plastic into the extruder hopper.
3. Power up the extruder and set the desired temperature using the 1209 temperature controller.
4. Once the hotend reaches the desired temperature, start the gear motor to extrude the melted plastic.
5. Collect the extruded filament for use in 3D printing projects.

## Safety Precautions:
- Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when operating the extruder, including gloves and safety glasses.
- Exercise caution when working with hot components to avoid burns or other injuries.
- Keep the workspace well-ventilated to prevent exposure to fumes from melting plastic.
